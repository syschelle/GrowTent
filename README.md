# GrowTent

> ⚡ Smart, adaptive grow tent controller with real-time climate stabilization and OTA updates

GrowTent is a compact ESP32-based grow-tent controller that reads temperature, humidity and computes VPD (Vapor Pressure Deficit) using a BME280 sensor.

It provides a web interface (German/English), relay control, automation logic and integrates with Shelly devices. The system is designed for **stable long-term operation** and **minimal manual intervention**.

## 🌡️ Adaptive Climate Smoothing

The system uses an **adaptive exponential moving average (EMA)** to balance
stability and responsiveness of sensor readings.

### How it works

- Raw sensor values are read from the BME280
- The system calculates the difference between consecutive readings
- Based on this delta, a dynamic smoothing factor (`alpha`) is applied:
  - small changes → strong smoothing
  - large changes → fast reaction

### Example

- Stable environment → smooth values  
- Opening a window → immediate response  

### Benefits

- Reduced sensor noise  
- Stable VPD calculation  
- Faster reaction to real changes  
- Improved control behavior  

## Hardware

- ESP32 4x or 8x relay board (any compatible dev board)
- Adafruit BME280 (I2C at default address 0x76)
- 4x relay channels (driven by ESP32 GPIOs)
- Power supply appropriate for ESP32 and relays
- HC-SR04 sensor 

### Default sensor and relay configuration in code:
- BME I2C address: `0x76` (BME_ADDR)
- DS18B20 sensor pin 4
- Relay count: `4` (NUM_RELAYS)
- 4x Relay pins (in order): `{ 32, 33, 25, 26 }` 
- 8x Relay pins (in order): `{32, 33, 25, 26, 27, 14, 12, 13 }`
- only for 8x Relay board connect Relay 6, 7, 8 to a peristaltic pump for watering the pods
- Shelly devices (Gen1/Gen2/Gen3 depending on endpoint support)

### Wiring notes:
- Connect BME280 SDA / SCL to ESP32 SDA / SCL (Wire library pins)
- Make sure common ground between relays and ESP32
- Relays are initialized as OUTPUT and driven LOW = OFF by default

### Relay Boards
- 4-channel relay board
- 8-channel relay board

## Web UI

The web frontend is embedded in program memory and served by the ESP32:
- Main page: `/` (index)
- Stylesheet: `/style.css`
- JavaScript: `/script.js`
- i18n manifest and language JSONs are served from memory
- Factory reset endpoint available via `POST /factory-reset` (form in UI)

UI highlights:
- Gauges for Temperature, Humidity and VPD
- Settings page for language, theme, date/time format, temperature unit, and NTP/timezone configuration
- Uses localStorage + Preferences for persistent settings across reloads
- Statuspage

Languages provided (i18n):
- German (`de`)
- English (`en`)

## VPD Calculation

VPD (kPa) is calculated from the measured temperature (°C) and relative humidity (%) using saturation vapor pressure (svp) approximation:

svp = 0.6108 * exp((17.27 * T) / (T + 237.3))
VPD = svp - (RH / 100) * svp

Values are updated by a background task and stored in:
- `lastTemperature`
- `lastHumidity`
- `lastVPD`

## Build & Flash (quick)

These are general instructions — adapt to your toolchain (Arduino IDE, PlatformIO, Arduino CLI, etc.)

1. Install required libraries:
   - Adafruit_BME280
   - Adafruit_Sensor

2. Select the correct ESP32 board in your build environment.

3. Build and flash to your ESP32 as usual.

Example (PlatformIO):
- pio run --target upload

Example (Arduino CLI):
- arduino-cli compile --fqbn <fqbn> .
- arduino-cli upload -p <port> --fqbn <fqbn> .

## Configuration & Tuning

- WiFi: You can set the device to Station mode or keep it in AP mode for direct connection.
- NTP and timezone: Set the NTP server and timezone string via the web UI.
- Relay behavior: By default relays are set LOW at startup. Update logic in code to change behavior.

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

- BME280 not found → check wiring & I2C address

If you want, I can:
- Generate a ready-to-commit README.md updated with more precise build commands for your preferred toolchain (PlatformIO / Arduino IDE / Arduino CLI).
- Create a wiring diagram (text-based) for the BME280 and relays.
- Create a sample config example or instructions for changing NTP/timezone/initial WiFi via the code.
